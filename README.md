## Troubleshooting

### Issues with Git and Render

I faced some challenges while linking my git project ot render. First my username did not allow to push the code, so i added my github credential globally and solved this.
After that my main branch name was main but in render it was written master so my build was failed many times later i figured this and solved this as well

### Design Challenge

Customize the output design based on my requirements was another challenge. I tried many time to get this final output
